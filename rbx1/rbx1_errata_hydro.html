<h2>RBX Volume 1 Errata for ROS Hydro</h2>

<ol>

  <li>There is a missing step in section <strong>4.7 Mixing catkin
and rosbuild Workspaces</strong>.<br>
In this section, you are instructed to add the following line to your
~/.bashrc file:<br>
<br><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">
source ~/ros_workspace/setup.bash</span></big><br>
    <br>
The missing step is that we also need to add the following line right
after the above line:<br>
    <br><big><span style="font-family: monospace;">
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH</span></big><br>
    <br>
This will ensure that your ~/ros_workspace directory remains in your
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>Referring to section 10.3.2, "Installing Webcam Drivers",
    instructions are provided for building Eric Perko's uvc_cam
    package.&nbsp; Eric's uvc_cam package still uses rosbuild so for those of
    you who are or might have trouble running both rosbuild workspace
    and a catkin work spaces together, I have created a catkinized
    version of uvc_cam.&nbsp; Below are the steps for installing it in you
    your catkin workspace directory.<br>

    <br>

    <b>NOTE</b>: If you are already successfully using the rosbuild
    version of the uvc_cam package, there is no need to install the
    catkinized version.&nbsp; The actual driver files are identical.<br>

    <br>

    The following commands assume that your catkin workspace directory
    is located at ~/catkin_ws.&nbsp; Substitute the appropriate directory if
    your location is different.<br>

    <br>

    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src<br>

    $ git clone https://github.com/pirobot/<wbr>uvc_cam.git<br>

    $ cd uvc_cam<br>

    $ git checkout hydro-devel<br>

    $ cd ~/catkin_ws<br>

    $ catkin_make<br>

    $ rospack profile<br>

    <br>

    You can then proceed to test your webcam following the instructions
    in section 10.3.4.</li>

</ol>
